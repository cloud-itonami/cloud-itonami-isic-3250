  "MedInstrAdvisor -- the *contained intelligence node* for the
  medical-and-dental-instrument plant-operations coordination actor.

  It normalizes production-batch patches (device-class/sterility-
  assurance-level/quantity/nonconformance-rate), drafts a machining/
  molding/sterilization-equipment maintenance scheduling proposal
  against a piece of equipment, drafts a safety-concern flag, and
  drafts an outbound medical/dental-instrument shipment coordination
  proposal against a production batch. CRITICAL: it is a
  smart-but-untrusted advisor. It returns a *proposal* (with a
  rationale + the fields it cited), never a committed record and
  NEVER a real machining/molding/sterilization-equipment actuation,
  freight dispatch, or FDA 510(k)/CE-mark regulatory clearance -- see
  README `What this actor does NOT do`. Every output is censored
  downstream by `medinstrmfg.governor` before anything touches the
  SSoT.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end. In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm or
  equivalent) with the same proposal shape.

  Proposal shape (all kinds):

  CRITICAL invariant this advisor upholds: every request it is asked to
  route MUST itself carry `:effect :propose` (the request-level
  contract every caller of this actor agrees to) --
  `medinstrmfg.governor` HARD-holds any request that doesn't, so a
  mis-wired caller can never reach a commit path even if this advisor
  were compromised."
